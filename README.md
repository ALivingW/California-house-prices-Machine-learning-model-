# California-house-prices-Machine-learning-model-

- Developed a Machine Learning Model which predicts the house prices in 
California using LinearRegression and RandomForesterRegressor algorithms
- Cleaned and pre-processed the dataset by handling missing values and
duplicated data and by applying log transformations to skewed data
- Applied One-Hot encoding to turn categorical features (e.g. Ocean proximity) 
into numerical data to appropriately train the model
- Split the dataset in an 80:20 train-test ratio and compared the accuracy of the 
different algorithms; RandomForestRegressor outperformed
LinearRegression in accuracy
